# Privacy Policy

DraftRoom Studios ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Notes to Reminders mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect any personal information.**

Notes to Reminders is designed with privacy as a core principle. All data processing happens entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or usage data.

### What We Don't Collect

- Personal identification information
- Usage data or analytics
- Device information
- Location data
- Notes content or checklist data
- Reminders content
- Any other personal data

## How the App Works

Notes to Reminders processes your checklist data entirely on your device:

1. You share a note from the Apple Notes app using the iOS share extension
2. The app reads the shared content locally on your device
3. The app creates reminders in your Apple Reminders app using Apple's native APIs
4. All processing happens locally - no data is sent to any server

## Data Storage

The app does not store any of your data. All checklist processing is done in memory and discarded after the import is complete.

## Third-Party Services

Notes to Reminders does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or tracking mechanisms.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone. Since we don't collect any data at all, the Service is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
